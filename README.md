# **ECommerce Back End Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**

For this assignment:

- I was attempting to build the back end of an ecommerce store.
- This applications routes are up and working utilizing Express.js API to use Sequilze to ineract with a MySQL database.
- Instead of using Insomnia to test routes, I used ThunderClient. My teacher told me this was okay to use instead because Insomnia is no longer free.
